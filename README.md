# GE13

## Description

GE13 is a [worldbuilding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding) calculator and information repository that aims to make the process of creating realistic worlds more accessible. 

The name GE13 is a reference to Genesis 1:3, which reads "And God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light".

The tools available here are mostly focused on large-scale objects (stars, planets, etc.) and  a top-down method of worldbuilding. I personally use them mostly as a guide, which gives me a solid foundation upon which to build.

The calculations assume the laws of physics still apply in the world you are building, if that is not the case, you may need to adjust the results accordingly.

For more information about worldbuilding, I recommend you check out [r/worldbuilding](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/) or watch the videos made by [Artifexian](https://www.youtube.com/c/Artifexian).
